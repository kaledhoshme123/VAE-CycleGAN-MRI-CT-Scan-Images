# VAE-CycleGAN-MRI-CT-Scan-Images
The study works on generating CT images from MRI images, where unsupervised learning was used using VAE-CycleGan. Since the number of samples included in the data set used in the study, and therefore in this case we are in a state of epistemic uncertainty, therefore probabilistic models were used in forming the latent space.
